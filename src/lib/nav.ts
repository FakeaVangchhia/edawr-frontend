 * Which routes each mobile tab stands for.
 *
 * This lives in `lib/` rather than inside `AppShell` because it is pure route
 * logic and because it was silently wrong for a long time with nothing to catch
 * it. Highlighting used to be `pathname.startsWith(tab.href)`, and this app's
 * routes are singular where its tabs are plural: the aisle page is
 * `/category/[slug]` behind a `/categories` tab, and the tracker is
 * `/order/[token]` behind `/orders`. Neither
 * `'/category/dairy'.startsWith('/categories')` nor
 * `'/order/abc'.startsWith('/orders')` is true, so the two journeys customers
 * make most — browsing an aisle, watching an order arrive — both drew a tab bar
 * with nothing selected at all.
 *
 * A component holding that rule could only be checked by rendering it, and this
 * package has no `@testing-library/react`. As a plain function it is covered by
 * `nav.test.ts`, so the next route added under a different name fails a test
 * rather than quietly unlighting a tab.
