 * derived from the name and resolved back by matching derived slugs. That means
 * a renamed category changes its URL, which is correct: the old URL described a

 * **Homepage rows.** The prototype this design came from drove its rows off
 * hardcoded tags — "Trending Near You", "Picked for You". There is no tag field
 * on `Product` and no personalisation in this system, so those rows would have
 * been decoration claiming to be data. Every row below is instead derived from
 * something the API actually says.
