 * Inter and JetBrains Mono, where the storefront uses IBM Plex Sans and
 * Manrope. A different typographic voice is the cheapest way to make it
 * obvious which of the two applications you are looking at — and both choices
 * earn their place beyond that: Inter's `tnum` gives the tabular figures every
 * table here depends on, and a real monospace makes SKUs, order ids and audit
 * diffs scannable in a way a proportional face cannot.
 *
 * Self-hosted by next/font, so `font-src 'self'` in the CSP needs no external
 * origin and there is no third-party request on first paint.
