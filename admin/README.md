# eDawr Console

The staff console: order fulfilment, catalogue, riders, analytics and account
management for Admins and Managers.

A **separate application** from `frontend/`. The storefront sells; this is the
instrument the shop is run with, and the two share no code, no design system and
no deployment. They share only the API.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # point NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL at the Django API
npm run dev               # http://localhost:3001
```

The API must allow this origin. In `backend/.env`:

```
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://localhost:3001,http://127.0.0.1:3001
```

Create the first account from `backend/` — the console has no sign-up, by design:

```bash
uv run manage.py seed_admin --email you@example.com --password '...' --role admin
```

## The two roles

| | Manager | Admin |
|---|---|---|
| Orders, products, categories, riders, settings | yes | yes |
| Cost prices, margins, all analytics | yes | yes |
| Create accounts and change roles | — | yes |
| Read the activity log | — | yes |

`src/lib/guard.ts` holds the capability map and is the only place the UI asks.
It decides what to *draw*; the server decides what is *allowed*, re-reading the
role from the database on every request. A Manager who types `/accounts` into
the address bar gets an explanation from the route guard and a 403 from the API.

## Things worth knowing before changing anything

- **401 and 403 are not the same.** Only a 401 clears the session. A 403 means
  "you, specifically, may not do this" and must never sign anyone out. See the
  interceptor in `src/lib/api.ts`.
- **`await connection()` in the root layout is load-bearing.** `src/proxy.ts`
  issues a per-request CSP nonce; a statically prerendered page would ship a
  build-time nonce, the browser would reject every script, and the app would
  never hydrate.
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is in the CSP.** Get it wrong and every screen renders
  while no data ever arrives. It is the first thing to check.
- **Editing a product sends `PATCH`, not `PUT`.** PUT writes every column from a
  body assembled when the form opened, so a sale during the edit is overwritten.
- **The category `PUT` is not partial.** Use `categoryPutBody()`; omitting a
  field resets it.
- **Money is never computed here.** Totals come from the server. `src/lib/format.ts`
  formats and does not add.

## Tests

```bash
npm test      # vitest — pure logic plus rendered components
npm run lint
```

`@testing-library/react` is installed, so components can be rendered in tests —
which is not true in `frontend/`.
